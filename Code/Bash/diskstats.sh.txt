# Diskstats monitoring script                                              #
# ---------------------------                                              #
# Scans /proc/diskstats on a 60 second interval and writes the             #
# reads/writes and read/write times (cumulative) to a file.                #
#                                                                          #
# Only tracks the dm devices (Device Mapper logical volumes aka VTS vaults)#
# and inserts date/time stamp to each output file line.                    #
# 								           #
# Output is a CSV file intended to be analysed in MS Excel on the desktop. #
#                                                                          #
